## Introduction

This project aims to predict the market value of used cars using a machine learning model. By training on historical data of car sales, the model can estimate a fair price for a car given its features. This tool can be useful for both buyers and sellers to ensure a transparent and data-driven valuation process.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and outlier detection.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts and creates meaningful features to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Selection**: Compares multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for the best performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizes Grid Search and Random Search to optimize model parameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Model Training

The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Various algorithms are applied, and their performance is compared using cross-validation. The best-performing model is selected and further tuned to maximize prediction accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors).
- **R² Score**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.


## Usage

1. Load the dataset into the project.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.
3. Train the model using the training script.
4. Evaluate the model using the evaluation script.
5. Use the model to predict the prices of used cars with the prediction script.
