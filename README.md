## Introduction

This project aims to predict the market value of used cars using a machine learning model. By training on historical data of car sales, the model can estimate a fair price for a car given its features. This tool can be useful for both buyers and sellers to ensure a transparent and data-driven valuation process.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and outlier detection.
- Feature Engineering: Extracts and creates meaningful features to improve model accuracy.
- Model Selection: Compares multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for the best performance.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizes Grid Search and Random Search to optimize model parameters.
- Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Model Training

The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Various algorithms are applied, and their performance is compared using cross-validation. The best-performing model is selected and further tuned to maximize prediction accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors).
- **R² Score**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

## Installation
